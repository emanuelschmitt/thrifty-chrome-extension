# Thrifty Chrome Extension

**Thrifty** is a Google Chrome Extension designed to make your life easier by searching for items across various classified ads platforms in Europe, such as Kleinanzeigen, Subito, Willhaben, Gumtree, Leboncoin, Marktplaats, and more. The plugin opens multiple tabs to find matching results for you.

## Motivation

Finding specific niche items, like vintage furniture or synthesizer eurorack modules, can often be a challenge. With **Thrifty**, you can search across multiple marketplaces and ads platforms, increasing your chances of finding that perfect item at a lower cost. I'd be glad if this plugin could also help others find the stuff they're looking for.
